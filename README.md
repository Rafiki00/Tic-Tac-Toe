# Tic-Tac-Toe

I have coded this little command line game of Tic Tac Toe using Python.
For this script I used only functions. 
Previously I made the Blackjack game using classes and I wanted to try out a different way of making a game.
Tic Tac Toe being simpler could make do with just a few functions and there was no need for classes but if the game were to be made more difficult (like adding strategy for the computer plays) then I would consider making classes.
